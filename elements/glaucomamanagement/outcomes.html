<h2>Outcomes of Goniotomy for Primary Congenital Glaucoma in East Africa</h2>
<p><i>Richard J. C. Bowman, MA, FRCOphth,1,2 Mary Dickerson, MBBS, BSc,3 Judith Mwende, MMed,1

<p>Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of goniotomy to treat primary congenital glaucoma in an east
African population.</p>
<p>Design: A retrospective series using case records. For patients who underwent goniotomies in both eyes,
only the first was analyzed.</p>
<p>
Participants: Forty-seven children undergoing goniotomy (47/80 operated eyes analyzed). Thirty-six children
(77%) were male. Mean age was 19 months (range 1–204 months, standard deviation [SD] _ 35).
Intervention: First goniotomy was performed from the temporal side. Repeat surgery, if necessary, was
performed via nasal side approach and 100% ethanol-soaked cotton-tipped swabs were used to clear the
corneal epithelium when necessary for angle visualization.</p>
<p>
Main Outcome Measures: Postoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) _21 mmHg was considered success.
Potential risk factors for failure were analyzed. Quantitative visual acuities were measured with Cardiff acuity
cards and Lea tests in older children.</p>
<p>
Results: A total of 36 of 47 children (77%) returned for follow-up. Mean follow-up interval was 12 months
(range, 1–62 months; SD _ 15). A total of 28 of 47 children (60%) had _3 months of follow-up, and 11 children
had _1 year of follow-up. A total of 12 of 47 eyes (26%) required repeat goniotomy. Three of these required
further trabeculectomy with mitomycin C, 1 of which required eventual enucleation after failure to control IOP,
enlargement, and pain. A total of 11 of 28 children (39%) with _3 months follow-up required repeat surgery. A
total of 24 of 28 children (86%) with follow-up intervals of at least 3 months achieved postoperative IOPs of _21
mmHg. Mean IOPs decreased (t_6.1, P _ 0.0005) from 23.4 mmHg (SD _ 5.3 mmHg) to 14.4 mmHg (SD _ 7.6
mmHg). Only 1 predictor of failure to achieve successful control of IOP was identified: female gender (relative
risk _ 5.3, 95% confidence interval, 1.1–26.3). Corneas were clear in 4 of 47 eyes (8.5%) preoperatively and 32
of 41 eyes (78%) postoperatively. Of 25 children with preoperative and postoperative acuities measured, 22
(88%) recorded improvement.</p>
<p>
Conclusions: Preliminary results of goniotomy in an African population with advanced disease and late
presentation are reasonably encouraging. Overall results are comparable with historical drainage procedures,
with the advantage of preserving conjunctiva. Further studies are justified.</p>
